h1. The Secret Ingredients of Ruby

These things make Ruby special. They aren't "advanced". They're fundamental:


# Blocks/closures
# Object-oriented vs. class-oriented (classes are less important than other languages, using mixins instead of inheritance, etc.)
# Class definitions are active (method calls in class scope, etc.)
# Hooks, callbacks, and reflection


Each of these four areas has an exercise and a homework project. The exercise is something that can be done in 30 minutes at the tutorial. The homework project is harder and probably involves reading some specific code.
